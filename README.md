# Transformer Implementation
An implementation of a character level Generatively Pretrained Transformer.
Our model is a smaller version of GPT-3, and is inspired by / adopted from Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).
See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) video to see Karpathy walk through the model, which was the cause (incredibly directly) of this project.
