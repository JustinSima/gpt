# Transformer Implementation
An implementation of a character based Generatively Pretrained Transformer.
Our model is a smaller version of GPT-3, and is inspired by / adopted from Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).
See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) video to see Karpathy walk through the model, which was the cause (incredibly directly) of this project.
The combination of broad context and fine details that Andrej brings to the video is truly inspring!
